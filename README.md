# CE_PlantMonitor

In this lesson, i build up an internet connected sensing installation. It will monitor the moisture of soil and you can check the status of the plant on a website showcasing the real-time data of the sensors.

The latest version with watering function. When the moisture is lower than certain number, the Red LED will be lighten up. You can press the button to watering the plant with the green led light at the same time.

## Common Issues

**1. No moisture value**

<center>
  <img src="./Links/issue01.png" alt="DHT22 Temp-Humidity Sensor" width="400">
</center>


  This mostly result from a extremly large resistance between two nails. 
    
For example, when you test the code at first, you may hold the two respectively with your hands, the voltage read by the analog pin is too small to return.

**2. Rasberry Pi SSH Connection**

The format for ssh connection is 

<u>"ssh {rasp pi username}@{rasp pi hostname}.local"</u>

The password is set up behind the username.

## Future

### 1. Build Website Interaction

Set up web connection to mqtt and interactive with a led light to remind people around the plant through sending message to a newly built topic.

Collect and visualize the data on the same website. Analyse the former status of plant, compute the last time someone watering plant.

### 2. Change the Watering Method with automatic control

Switching from top watering to bottom watering and adding an automatic control module that allows people to operate it from the website above. 

Bottom watering can prevent the topsoil from becoming too compact, allowing water to flow smoothly and avoiding waterlogging, which can attract many mosquitoes.

### 3. Parametric model for 3d Enclosure

Estabilish a parameteric model that fits various pot sizes. With combination of 3D printing tech, we can finish the 3D enclosure models quickly.

The general workflow for the parametric model:

- Input: Port Shape, Port Size, Depth of the Gap

- Output: STL Format Model (For 3D Modelling)

A simple demo in Rhino.
